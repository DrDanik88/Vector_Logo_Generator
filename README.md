  ## Description
  This is an SVG logo generator. Altough quite simple, you can easily see the comments in the code to guide you on what everything does. It is more of an experience on using code like sync and async type, or how to write different types of functions that can either wait or not for each others.
  
  ## Installation

  <br>**It is better to run it in an outside terminal instead of the integrated terminal of VSCode.
